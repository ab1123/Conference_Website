        <h2>About NCRAPS-2025</h2>
        <p>
          The National Conference on “Recent Advancement in Physical Sciences
          (NCRAPS-2025)” will be held offline. This conference is the 6th
          edition of an NCRAPS series started in 2019. The vision behind
          organizing this conference is to provide an excellent forum for
          researchers, scientists, and industry persons from interdisciplinary
          areas to showcase their current contributions in the recent area of
          Physical Sciences. The objectives of NCRAPS-2025 are to abreast the
          young minds from Institutes, Universities, Colleges, and Industries
          across the country, with the latest advancements in the field of this
          area, and to provide them an opportunity to share their recent
          research and views in various fields of Physical Sciences and their
          applications for the ultimate benefit of the Society and Industry. The
          broad aim of the conference is to groom young scientists to face
          future challenges for effective and efficient professional
          responsibilities. The conference will cover a wide range of topics in
          the form of plenary speakers, keynote speakers, invited talks &
